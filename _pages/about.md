👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Mechatronics Engineer graduate student at the Centro de Enseñanza Técnica Industrial (CETI).

🔬 I consider myself as a passionate engineer with a solid technical background and commercial skills, driving innovation and growth in the technology and telecommunications sector across multiple countries. Committed to developing advanced solutions for technical challenges and expanding business opportunities.

📚 I'm currently working in a telecomunications company leading the andean.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I work on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
