👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Mechatronics Engineer graduate student at the Centro de Enseñanza Técnica Industrial (CETI).

🔬 I consider myself as a passionate engineer with a solid technical background and commercial skills, driving innovation and growth in the technology and telecommunications sector across multiple countries. Committed to developing advanced solutions for technical challenges and expanding business opportunities.

📚 I'm currently working in a telecomunications company leading the andean region (Colombia, Perú, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador).

📽️ I possess a strong ability to establish long-term relationships and close deals in the B2B sector. My focus on building solid connections with clients has proven effective in generating sustainable revenue and retaining customers over time. 

👨🏻‍💻I have had the opportunity to work on projects and negotiations with leading operators in South America, such as projects with American Movil,  Millicom, Huawei, ZTE, among others.

👨🏻‍💻 In 2020, in collaboration with my brother, we established a venture named Mr. Clean Shoes, a business dedicated to cleaning and restoring all types of footwear. This experience has provided me with insights into the workings of customer care and service.
